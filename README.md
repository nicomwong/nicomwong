Hey! I'm a DevOps Engineer at [Advocates for Human Potential](https://www.ahpnet.com/).\
Previously, I was a Software Engineer working at Amazon where I contributed to the development of a backend graph database management system. The system supported product metadata and ontology on the [amazon.com](https://www.amazon.com/) e-commerce website.

My favorite hobby is working on the terminal!
