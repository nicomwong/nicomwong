Hey! I'm a DevOps Egineer at [Advocates for Human Potential](https://www.ahpnet.com/).\
Previously, I was a Software Engineer working at Amazon on a backend graph database for their e-commerce website, [amazon.com](https://www.amazon.com/).

My favorite hobby is working in the terminal and using Vim!
