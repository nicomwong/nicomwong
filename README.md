### Hey!

I'm a junior DevOps engineer at Advocates for Human Potential.
I previously worked as a backend software engineer at Amazon for the e-commerce website.
I am currently interested in learning about cloud computing & infrastructure and software engineering tool development.
I am also looking to learn Python and GoLang!
