Hey! I'm a DevOps / SRE and Software Engineer.

I most recently worked as a DevOps Engineer at [Advocates for Human Potential](https://www.ahpnet.com/) working on CI/CD pipelines and code builds and deployments utilizing AWS services, Linux, Terraform, AWS CloudFormation, and Python.\
Previously, I was a Software Engineer working at Amazon where I contributed to the development of a backend graph database management system. The system supported product metadata and ontology on the [amazon.com](https://www.amazon.com/) e-commerce site.

My favorite hobby is working on the terminal!
